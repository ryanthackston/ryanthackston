Graduate Student Researcher that did Feature Engineering and developed Data Pipelines on EEG/MEG bio-signals at the Noninvasive BMI lab at University of Houston. Used Python Numpy, Pandas, SciPy, SciKit-Learn, and Tensorflow libraries

Created an Inventory Database Management System for the local student IEEE chapter at the University of Houston in Python and SQLite.

Knowledgeable in Functional Programming.

In a group, created a Bitcoin trading bot using Python Keras and Tensorflow libraries. Used ARIMA & GARCH statistical methods to analyze volatility and forecast trendline. Used a ResNet with Squeeze Excitation along with Blurpool method and GlobalWeightPooling.

Conducted a data science meta analysis of brain-related research with a project partner in R, SQL, and PowerBi. Constructed statistical models of interconnected social networks and logistic regression of researchers publishing in brain science research. Results show that researchers who were cross-disciplinary and cited a large amount 20 years ago had much higher citation results today and were the foundation of most research in all disciplines of brain science research compared with researchers who weren't cross-disciplinary.

Learning Java Collections, Generics, I/O, JVM, Multi Threading, Optionals, Dependency Injection, Design Patterns, Testing, Databases, and Spring Boot.
